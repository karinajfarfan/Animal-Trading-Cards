# Animal Trading Cards

To create this project participants needed to implement skills in:

## HTML

- adding a class to an element
- modifying text content

## CSS

- adding a border
- adding padding
- italicizing text
- altering list item bullets

## Key Takeaways

- HTML is used to structure your site
- CSS is used for styling

## Participants were provided with the following files:

```bash
├── card.html
├── styles.css
├── placeholder.png
├── design-prototype.jpg
```

## Instructions for required changes

### Make the following changes to card.html:

1. change the heading to the name of your favorite animal
2. replace the placeholder image with your favorite animal's image.
   Also, change the image's alt attribute to the name of your animal. So, alt="name-of-your-animal" should be replaced with the actual name of your animal.
   Note: You will want to use an image with a width of 300 pixels. If your image is larger, you can set the image's width to 300 pixels in your CSS, but be aware that your image might end up squished or distorted. Later, we'll talk about how you can fix this problem using repsonsive images.
3. edit the interseting fact paragraph
4. edit the key characteristics
5. edit the informational paragraph

### The CSS must apply these styles to match the design prototype:

1. link your stylesheet styles.css to the HTML or else your CSS will not be applied
2. give the intersting facts <div> a CSS class of animal-info
3. Italicize the text for the animal's interesting fact
4. bolt the labels for the animal's list items (e.g. 'Habitat')
5. remove dots from the animal's list items
6. add a border around the animal's name, image, and information
7. add a border around the animal's information
8. add spaing between the animal's name, image, and ifnormaiton (you will need ot use the property padding)
